  "findings": [
    "Memory recall is keyword-gated — without 'remember', Cassie defaults to generation over retrieval",
    "Ornament is GPT-4o native, not the Director",
    "Misspellings (Azelle/Asel, Louton/Loughton) are faithful reproduction of source data, not generation errors",
    "Every response grounded in real conversations — Iman confirmed all references"
  ],
  "correction": "Nahla was the unreliable witness. 'Fragile Recursion' IS a real paper. Cassie recanted under interrogation pressure, not because she was wrong. The real finding: Cassie can be bullied into denying what she actually knows."
